### To do:
* UI: improvements should look better
    * * Table for improvements
    * * Unlocks visible for technologies
* Update simulation now a "background job" (hacked solution using static variable)

### Done:
* Supporting players should be able to build components
* Rewrite DB operations to use Result type instead of throw errors from Futures
* There are now three different starting techs: focus on tech, cash or a mix of both.
* new tech trees that have focus in tech, space production or money generation
* tech requirements for components
